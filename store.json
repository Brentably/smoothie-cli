      "content": "You can turn a buffer from child_process.execSync into a readable string by calling the `toString()` method on the buffer. Here is an example code:\n\n```\nconst { execSync } = require('child_process');\nconst resultBuffer = execSync('ping google.com');\nconst resultString = resultBuffer.toString();\nconsole.log(resultString);\n```\n\nIn the above code, we are executing a `ping google.com` command using the `execSync` method of the `child_process` module. This returns a buffer containing the output of the command. We then call the `toString()` method on this buffer to get a readable string, and log it to the console.\n\nNote that if the output of the command is in a specific encoding, you can also pass that as an argument to the `toString()` method. For example, if the command outputs in utf-8 encoding, you can call `resultBuffer.toString('utf-8')` to get a readable string in that encoding."

First, I need to know which programming language you would like to use for this task, and what content you want to put in the file. \n\nFor example, if you want to write a file in Node.js and store \"Hello, World!\" in the file \"babayega.txt\", you can use the following code:\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nconst content = 'Hello, World!';\n\nfs.writeFile('babayega.txt', content, 'utf8', (err) => {\n  if (err) {\n    console.log('An error occured while writing the file:', err);\n  } else {\n    console.log('File has been written successfully');\n  }\n});\n```\n\nJust let me know your preferred programming language and the content you want to store in the file, and I'll be happy to help."
