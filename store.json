      "content": "You can turn a buffer from child_process.execSync into a readable string by calling the `toString()` method on the buffer. Here is an example code:\n\n```\nconst { execSync } = require('child_process');\nconst resultBuffer = execSync('ping google.com');\nconst resultString = resultBuffer.toString();\nconsole.log(resultString);\n```\n\nIn the above code, we are executing a `ping google.com` command using the `execSync` method of the `child_process` module. This returns a buffer containing the output of the command. We then call the `toString()` method on this buffer to get a readable string, and log it to the console.\n\nNote that if the output of the command is in a specific encoding, you can also pass that as an argument to the `toString()` method. For example, if the command outputs in utf-8 encoding, you can call `resultBuffer.toString('utf-8')` to get a readable string in that encoding."
